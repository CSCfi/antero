command is mandatory argument. The SQL to execute.
expect  is for getting results from a query.
        For ease of use one can tell from one row return query the column which value is expected.
        Special case is "row count" which will just return the number of rows query returns.
        Somewhat default behaviour is to return the whole result set as an array of dicts.
        You can achieve default behaviour by giving a value to this argument that is not part
        of column names in result, for ex. "*", and/or results give exactly NOT one row.
return is an optional argument. By default the dbcommand prints the result to shell. With this
        paremeter the dbcommand returns the result to user.
